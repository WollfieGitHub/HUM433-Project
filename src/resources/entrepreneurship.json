	"In the realm of startup ventures, entrepreneurship intersects with the world of investors and funding mechanisms. Angel investors, venture capitalists, and seed-stage funding play crucial roles in nurturing early-stage startups. Angel investors are affluent individuals who provide capital and mentorship to promising startups in exchange for equity ownership. Venture capitalists are institutional investors who specialize in funding high-growth potential startups. The seed stage is the initial phase of a startup's development, where founders seek funding to validate their business concept, build prototypes, and establish market traction. This stage is pivotal in laying the foundation for future growth and attracting further investment."
